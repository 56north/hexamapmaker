Description: Takes a set of points in a x and y coordinate and turns
    them into hexagons. The idea is, that you can quickly design the layout of
    a hexagon map by just adding points in a coordinate system. Then the hexamap
    function turns them into hexagon-shaped polygons that can be plotted with
    'ggplot2'.
